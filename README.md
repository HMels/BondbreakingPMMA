## System Requirements

This model requires a server with access to the full model of T. Verduin.

## Installation

To install the Bondbreaking C++ Model, the user must have access to the full model of T. Verduin.

## Usage

The Bondbreaking C++ Model can be used to model the bondbreaking effect in PMMA for e-beam lithography.

## Known Bugs and Issues
